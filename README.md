# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis - Interpreting Correlation
In this activity, my primary goal was to identify correlations between various lifestyle choices and insurance costs.

To achieve this, I systematically analysed an anonymised dataset, focusing on key factors such as BMI, smoker status, age, and number of children, using both visualisations and statistical methods.

The scatterplots and boxplots provided a clear view of the relationships, allowing me to detect patterns and outliers. The Pearson and Spearman correlation tests helped quantify these relationships, highlighting which factors had significant effects on insurance charges.

Throughout this process, I was mindful of potential biases and limitations, such as the influence of outliers and the need for appropriate correlation methods based on data types. This approach ensured that my analysis was thorough, objective, and led to actionable insights for the investment firm.
